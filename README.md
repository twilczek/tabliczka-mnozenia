Multiplication & Division App with Review Mode

1. Project Overview

This is a browser-based application designed to help children practice multiplication and division, with an additional review mode for re-solving incorrect answers. All data (scores, mistakes, settings) is stored locally using localStorage. A timer (defaulting to 10 seconds per question) is always active to encourage quick responses.
Communication has to BE IN POLISH.

2. Tech Stack
	•	Framework: React + Vite
	•	Styling: Tailwind CSS
	•	Data Storage: localStorage (tracking results and mistakes)
	•	Deployment: Railway (using Nixpacks)

3. Functionalities
	1.	Multiplication Mode
	•	Generates random multiplication problems within a user-defined range.
	•	Lets users set the number of questions per session (e.g., 10).
	•	Always displays a 10-second timer per question.
	•	Stores incorrect answers in localStorage for later review.
	•	Provides immediate feedback:
	•	If correct, show confirmation.
	•	If incorrect, show the correct answer.
	2.	Division Mode
	•	Same logic as multiplication, but with division problems.
	•	Two number range options for division:
	•	Up to 50 (e.g., 2–50)
	•	50–100
	•	Displays a 10-second timer per question.
	•	Incorrect answers are stored for review.
	•	Immediate feedback (correct vs. correct answer).
	3.	Review Mode
	•	Pulls all previously incorrect answers from localStorage.
	•	Allows the user to re-answer these questions.
	•	Shows the correct answer if the user is still wrong.
	•	Removes questions from the review list once answered correctly.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Offline-First: Works entirely in the browser, relying on localStorage.
	•	Responsive Design: Large buttons, readable text, and a clear layout for mobile and desktop.
	•	Performance: Minimal loading time; everything runs client-side.
	•	Accessibility: Use clear fonts and color contrast suitable for children.

5. App Structure
	1.	Home Screen
	•	Buttons for:
	•	Multiplication
	•	Division
	•	Review
	2.	Settings / Configuration (for Multiplication or Division)
	•	Set the number range (e.g., for multiplication) or pick the division range (up to 50 or 50–100).
	•	Set how many questions will be asked (e.g., 10).
	•	Click “Start” to begin.
	3.	Question Screen
	•	Shows the current problem (multiplication or division).
	•	Provides an input for the answer.
	•	Displays a 10-second countdown timer.
	•	After submitting, indicates correct/incorrect.
	•	Moves to the next question.
	4.	Review Screen
	•	Lists previously missed questions.
	•	Let the user solve them again with the same 10-second timer.
	•	Shows correct/incorrect feedback and removes correct ones from the list.
	5.	Results Screen
	•	Summarizes correct and incorrect answers.
	•	Option to retry or return to the home screen.

6. State Management
	•	Maintain global state (e.g., via React Context or a similar solution) for:
	•	Current mode (multiplication or division).
	•	Question count.
	•	Timer state.
	•	Correct/incorrect answers.
	•	Update localStorage after each session to track mistakes.

7. Data Handling
	•	For multiplication or division, randomly generate numbers within the chosen range.
	•	Store missed questions in localStorage with their details (question, correct answer, user’s wrong attempt).
	•	Remove questions from localStorage once correctly answered in Review Mode.

8. Appearance & UX
	•	Child-friendly UI with large buttons, clear labels, and concise text.
	•	The 10-second timer is always visible to provide a sense of urgency.
	•	Display immediate feedback on every answer (correct or show correct answer if wrong).

9. Testing
	•	Validate core logic for generating random questions and handling answers.
	•	Check localStorage read/write operations.
	•	Confirm that the timer and feedback mechanism work correctly in different scenarios.

10. Deployment
	•	Use Nixpacks on Railway for an easy, containerized deployment.
	•	Ensure the app runs as a static build (generated by Vite).
	•	Confirm localStorage functions properly in the deployed environment.

Summary:
This plan outlines a React + Vite + Tailwind app that helps children practice multiplication and division (two ranges for division) with a default 10-second timer on every question. It stores mistakes in localStorage for a dedicated review mode. Everything runs client-side, and the final deployment is on Railway using Nixpacks.
